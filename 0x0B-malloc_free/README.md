This is mt ALX project on malloc() and free() in C programming.
malloc and free are functions in C that are used to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory.

malloc is used to allocate a block of memory on the heap, and returns a pointer to the beginning of the block.
free is used to deallocate memory that was previously allocated with malloc.
